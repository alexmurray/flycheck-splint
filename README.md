Flycheck splint Checker
======================

Integrate [splint](http://splint.org) with [flycheck](http://www.flycheck.org).

If [irony](https://github.com/Sarcasm/irony-mode) is configured the compiler
flags etc used by that are automatically passed to `splint` to enable an almost
seamless out-of-the-box experience.

Currently this has only been tested with Emacs 24.4 and a very recent version of
flycheck.
